### Capture Sequence

Capture can only be perfomed on a payment with a successfully authorized
transaction.
It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount
than the authorized amount.
You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total
authorization amount.

```mermaid

  Merchant->>PayEx: POST <creditcard capture>
  Activate Merchant
  Activate PayEx
  PayEx-->>Merchant: transaction resource
  Deactivate PayEx
  Deactivate Merchant
```

### Cancel Sequence

Cancel can only be done on a authorized transaction.
If you do cancel after doing a part-capture you will cancel the difference
between the captured amount and the authorized amount.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Merchant->>PayEx: POST <creditcard cancellation>
  Activate Merchant
  Activate PayEx
  PayEx-->>Merchant: transaction resource
  Deactivate PayEx
  Deactivate Merchant
```

### Reversal Sequence

Reversal can only be done on a payment where there are some captured amount
not yet reversed.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Merchant->>PayEx: POST <creditcard reversal>
  Activate Merchant
  Activate PayEx
  PayEx-->>Merchant: transaction resource
  Deactivate PayEx
  Deactivate Merchant
```

### Abort a payment

returned in the payment request. You need to include the following HTTP body:
