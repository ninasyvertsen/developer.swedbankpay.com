## Create Payment

Within the card payments part of the eCommerce API, you can create four kinds
of payments  ([purchase][purchase], [recurrence][recurrence], [payout][payout]
and [verification][verify]) and you can inspect and alter the details of the
individual transactions within the payment.

To create a card payment, you perform an HTTP `POST` against the `payments`
resource.

There are four different kinds of payment that can be created. These are
identified with the value of the `operation` property. Each kind are documented
in their own section below.

## Payout

> "Payout to Card" is an add-on service that enable you to deposit winnings
  directly to your end-users' credit cards. This without  the need to collect
  card details from the end-user a second time.

### Introduction

* Acquirer for this service is Swedbank. You require a separate Swedbank
  acquiring number to ensure that payout transactions and regular card
  transactions are kept separate.
* You need to have the 3-D Secure protocol enabled.
* The service is available through a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page.
* The current implementation is only available for gaming transactions (
  [MCC][mcc]: 7995).
* The payout service is not a part of Swedbank Pay Settlement Service.

### API requests

The API requests are displayed in the [payout flow](#payout-flow).  You create
a payout by performing a `POST` creditcard payments with key `operation` set to
`payout`.

### Payout flow

You must set `Operation` to `Payout` in the initial `POST` request.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  activate Consumer
  Consumer->>-Merchant: Start payout
  activate Merchant
  Merchant->>-SwedbankPay: POST [Credit Card Payout]
  activate SwedbankPay
  SwedbankPay-->>-Merchant: Payment resource
  activate Merchant
  Merchant-->>-Consumer: Display Payout result
```

## Verify

> The `Verify` operation lets you post verification payments, which are used to
  confirm validity of card information without reserving or charging any amount.

### Introduction to Verify

This option is commonly used when initiating a subsequent
[One-click card payment][one-click-payments] or a
[recurring card payment][recurrence] flow - where you do not want
to charge the consumer right away.

{% include alert.html type="neutral" icon="info" body="
Please note that all boolean credit card attributes involving rejection of
certain card types are optional and requires enabling on the contract with
Swedbank Pay." %}

### Verification through Swedbank Pay Payments

* When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer initiates a
  verification operation, you make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with
  your Verify information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
  `paymentID`. You either receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page or a
  JavaScript source in response.
* You need to [redirect][redirect] the payer's browser to that specified URL, or
  embed the script source on your site to create a [Hosted View][hosted-view] in
  an `iframe`; so that she can enter the credit card details in a secure
  Swedbank Pay hosted environment.
* Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication when this is required.
* Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer's browser to - or display directly in the
  `iframe` - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment session
  is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note that both
  a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled
  payment.
* When you detect that the payer reach your completeUrl , you need to do a `GET`
  request to receive the state of the transaction.
* Finally you will make a `GET` request towards Swedbank Pay with the
  `paymentID` received in the first step, which will return the payment result
  and a `paymentToken` that can be used for subsequent [One-Click
  Payments][one-click-payments] and [recurring server-to-server based
  payments][recurrence].

### Screenshots

You will redirect the consumer/end-user to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect
the credit card information.

### Verification flow

The sequence diagram below shows the two requests you have to send to Swedbank
Pay to make a purchase. The links will take you directly to the API description
for the specific request. The diagram also shows in high level, the sequence of
the process of a complete purchase.
When dealing with credit card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the
cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a
credit card payment:

* 3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank
  Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the
  issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no
  authentication of the cardholder is done.
* Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank
  Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is
  decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile
  BankID.

## Problems

When performing unsuccessful operations, the eCommerce API will respond with a
problem message. We generally use the problem message `type` and `status` code
to identify the nature of the problem. The problem `name` and `description` will
often help narrow down the specifics of the problem.

### Contractual Problem Types
