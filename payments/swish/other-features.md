### Problem messages

When performing unsuccessful operations, the eCommerce API will respond with a
problem message.
We generally use the problem message type and status code to identify
the nature of the problem.
The problem name and description will often help narrow down the specifics
of the problem.

### Error types from Swish and third parties

All Swish error types will have the following URI in front of type:
`https://api.externalintegration.payex.com/psp/<errordetail>/swish`
